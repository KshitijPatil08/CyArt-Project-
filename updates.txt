I'm going to create an updated todo list that tracks the testing steps your teammate and you should run; expected outcome: clear, actionable test/checklist with one item marked in-progress for the live test you're about to run.

Starting (3/7) Run backend and verify endpoints

Done — the testing todo list is saved and I marked item 3 ("Run backend and verify endpoints") as in-progress because you're testing now.

Next — a concise quick-run checklist and copyable PowerShell commands you can run locally to verify the integration and help your teammate:

What to ask your teammate
Public IP or DNS of the Wazuh server
Wazuh API credentials (username and password) or a service account
Whether they generated agent authentication keys (if you need to register agents)
Confirm firewall rules allow ports: 1514 (agent comm), 1515 (registration), 55000 (Wazuh API)
Confirm CORS enabled on Wazuh API if you plan browser direct calls
Configure your backend
Copy .env.example -> .env in backend and set:
WAZUH_API_URL=https://THEIR_PUBLIC_IP:55000
WAZUH_API_USER=their_user
WAZUH_API_PASSWORD=their_password
PORT=3000
PowerShell:

Start the backend and watch logs
PowerShell:
What to watch for:

Console output: server listening on port 3000
Any errors about connecting to Wazuh (auth errors, SSL errors)
Quick API checks (PowerShell curl-like with Invoke-RestMethod)
Health:
Devices:
Logs sample:
Expected: JSON with devices, connections, or logs. If you get 500, copy the backend console error.

Test WebSocket connection (quick browser or wscat)
If you have Node wscat installed (npm install -g wscat), from PowerShell:
Expected: connection accepted; server may push device updates periodically.

Start frontend dev server and open UI
PowerShell:
Open browser: http://localhost:5173/devices (or the printed Vite dev URL)
What to check:

Network Topology renders nodes
Console for CORS or API errors (copy any error)
Live updates when agents connect/disconnect
Test registering an agent (teammate's Ubuntu server)
Server admin runs (on Ubuntu server):
Agent side (on the machine you want to register):

Then on server:

Expected: agent appears on server, then your backend /api/devices and frontend will show agent.

Peripheral (USB) tests
On the agent machine: plug in a USB pendrive
Check agent logs:
Linux agent: /var/ossec/logs/ossec.log
Backend/Web UI: device/peripheral should appear in the visualization and notifications
If anything fails — what to collect and share
Backend console log (copy the error stack)
Frontend browser console error and network tab (failed requests)
Output of a failing curl/Invoke-RestMethod
Wazuh server logs: /var/ossec/logs/ossec.log and Wazuh API logs
Firewall/nftables/ufw rules on Wazuh server (command sudo ufw status)
Quick troubleshooting pointers
If you see SSL errors: confirm WAZUH_API_URL uses https and TLS certs are valid; for dev you can set secure: false but remove for prod.
If you see CORS errors in browser: ensure teammate added CORS config in /var/ossec/api/configuration/api.yaml and restarted wazuh-api.
If API auth fails: re-check username/password and try Wazuh API login manually (curl with basic auth) from your backend host.
After tests: update todo list statuses
Tell me the results (success / error output). I can then:
Interpret errors
Patch code or config
Add logging or fix CORS/auth issues
